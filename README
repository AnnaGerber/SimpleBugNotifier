Simple server that polls twitter and RSS and posts events for the Ambient Bugs project at The Edge.

This code was developed at Hack the Evening at The Edge.

The bugs make bug sounds and glow in different colours everytime when someone tweets about the Edge (@slqedge, #slqedge) or when there is an action on the Edge website (e.g. someone posts something, signs up for the Edge social network, joins a group, etc).

We equipped each of the three bugs with LED eyes that can glow, an EL-wired body that can blink and a speaker for the sound. The bugs are built using arduino and have a REST API for interested people to create their own applications and make the bugs glow, blink and sound when a particular event happens.
